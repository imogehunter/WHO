				<b>Ruben Sanchez:</b><br>
				In a children’s home and secondary school in Pau, south-western France, Ruben Sanchez sought the help of social workers and students for refuge and safety after  stating that he had run away when both his parents were killed in a car crash. No one blinked an eye with Sanchez’s perfect teenage gestures and slang, as well as his husky pubescent voice. It was not until a month into his stay that it was apparent that Sanchez was not in fact that teenage kid he was pretending to be, after a teacher stumbled upon a television programme recounting the life story of  the infamous impersonator, Frederic Bourdin.
