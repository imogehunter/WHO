		<b>Nicholas Barclay:</b><br>
		In 1994, 13 year old Nicholas Barclay went missing from his hometown of San Antonio, Texas. Three years later when he was 16 he was rediscovered by police officers, and despite his appearance drastically changing such as his darker hair, different eye colour and newfound accent, his family did not notice anything unusual, and were convinced that it was the same person. Supposedly, Barclay had spend the last three years being tortured and forced into prostitution on a completely different continent. It would take Barclay’s family, and those around him five months to realise that the boy that they welcomed into their hoe was intact not Nicolas Barclay, but instead was actually a 23 year old imposter, Federic Bourdin
