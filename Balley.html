    <b>Leo Balley:</b><br>
    In 1996 on a trip in Isere, France, 6 year old Leo Balley disappeared from his families camp site in the 2000m high Taillefer mountain, around 5.30pm. He was following his group of family and friends who where en route to a lake when he got bored and decided to make his own way back to camp just 100m away. However, he was never seen again, despite extensive search and investigation efforts. The case was thought to be closed until 8 years later in 2003, when Leo reappeared, claiming to have escaped from his abductor. However, DNA testing found that in-fact it was not Leo at all, but again an elaborate impersonation by Frederic Bourdin’s after his recent release from prison for impersonating Nicholas Barclay.
